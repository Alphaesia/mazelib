//! Everything to do with reading and manipulating a maze at a high-level.
//!
//! Mazes are fundamentally a collection of cells. These collections are stored
//! in [MazeBuffer][crate::interface::buffer::MazeBuffer]s.
//!
//! Each cell has a value. While different types of cells can store different information,
//! the value of each cell is one of four [types][CellValueType]: [PASSAGE][CellValueType::PASSAGE],
//! [WALL][CellValueType::WALL], [BOUNDARY][CellValueType::BOUNDARY], or
//! [UNVISITED][CellValueType::UNVISITED].
//!
//! While a collection of cells constitutes a maze, they need to be
//! interpreted before any useful analysis can be done. This is the purpose
//! of [CellManager] - to hold the necessary information for interpreting
//! cells.
//!
//! Recommended reading order:
//! 1. [CellValue]
//! 2. [CellValueType]
//! 3. [CellManager]

///
/// A cell space determines how cells physically connect.
///
/// It operates on a conceptual level between the raw storage (the buffer) and the abstract
/// graph representation of the maze - the cell space arbitrates how individual cells connect.
///
/// A CellSpace handles updating the maze buffer. When you or a generator want to modify a
/// cell, you must talk to the associated cell space.
///
/// For instance, if the generator wants to connect two cells together as passages, the
/// cell space is responsible for updating the buffer with the relevant cell changes
/// (e.g. removing the adjacent wall from the origin cell, and marking the destination cell
/// as visited).
///
/// A maze is accompanied by a cell space at all times, and it cannot be changed after creation.
/// It is a logical error to use a cell space with a different maze object, or a maze object
/// with a different cell space.
///
/// Passing in an out-of-bounds point as an argument will cause a panic with debug assertions
/// enabled, and is undefined with them off. However, an out-of-bounds point will never cause
/// an out-of-bounds write; memory safety is always preserved.
///
/// *Note: In the source, `<<Self as CellManager>::CoordSpace as CoordinateSpace>::PtType` is
/// contracted to `pt!()` for readability.*
///
/// # Selecting a Cell Space
///
/// The cell space you use will depend entirely based on the types of coordinate space and
/// cell values you use.
///
/// There is a list of built-in CellSpaces under the [Implementors](#implementors) header at
/// the bottom of this page. If it does not contain the combination of coordinate space and
/// cell value you want, or if you are using custom coordinate spaces / cell values, you will
/// need to implement your own.
