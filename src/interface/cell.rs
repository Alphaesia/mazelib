//! Reading and manipulating mazes at a high level.
//!
//! Mazes are fundamentally a collection of cells. These collections are stored in
//! [`MazeBuffer`][crate::interface::buffer::MazeBuffer]s.
//!
//! While a collection of cells constitutes a maze, they need to be interpreted before any
//! useful analysis can be done. This is the purpose of the [`CellManager`] - to hold the
//! necessary information for interpreting cells.
//!
//! # Recommended Reading
//!
//! 1. [`crate::interface`'s section on cells][crate::interface#cell] --- a detailed introduction
//! to cells and what they are.
//! 2. [`ConnectionType`] --- the ways that points can be connected.
//! 3. [`CellManager`] --- the unifying glue and centre of the maze model.
