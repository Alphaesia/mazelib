/// # Implementation
///
/// With regards to implementation, points are or similar to coordinate

/// must effectively act like them. More specifically, they must have the
/// following properties:
/// * Immutable
/// * Fixed Size
/// * Cloneable
/// * Equality must be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, *and anti-symmetric*
/// * Hashable
