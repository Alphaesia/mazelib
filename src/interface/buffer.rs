/// Maze buffers store the values of all cells in a maze. This is the meat of the maze. They are
/// not responsible for other [core maze components], which are held by the
/// [cell manager][crate::interface::cell::CellManager] instead.
///
/// A buffer's size is determined at construction, and cannot be changed.
///
/// Buffers are very low-level and not intended to be interacted with directly. They should
/// always be accessed through the maze's cell manager.
///
/// Likewise, they should not be constructed directly. The maze's cell manager is responsible
/// for the construction of the buffer.
///
/// While most buffers would store their contents in memory, it is conceivable that a buffer
/// could stream the maze from disk (or elsewhere). This would allow mazes too big to fit in
/// memory to be generated.
