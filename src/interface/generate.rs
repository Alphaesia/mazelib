//! Generating mazes.
//!
//! As an abstraction, generating mazes is simple. You instantiate a generator then hand
//! off your [maze][crate::interface::maze::Maze] to it. Once the generator returns, you
//! have your generated maze.
//!
//! # Recommended Reading
//!
//! 1. [`MazeGenerator`] --- the generator interface.
//! 2. [`crate::implm::generate`] --- a comparison of the built-in generators.

/// A maze generator.
///
/// A generator traverses a maze's [graph][crate::interface::point::CoordinateSpace],
/// setting <abbr title="Connections between points">edges</abbr> to be passages or walls
/// as it goes. How exactly this is done differs between implementations. In fact, this
/// is the main differentiator between generators.
///
/// Generators do not consider mazes at the cellular level. They only jump from point to
/// point.
///
/// Most implementations will define a static
/// [`Implementation::generate(maze: &mut Maze)`][DefaultMazeGenerator::generate] that
/// will generate a maze using some default generator parameters. It also saves you having
/// to construct the generator struct yourself.

    /// during execution, the maze may be left in a partially-generated state (different
