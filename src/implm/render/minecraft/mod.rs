/// Render a two-dimensional maze (i.e. `BoxCoordinateSpace<2>`) into a Minecraft schematic
/// and return it.
///
/// Specifically, it renders the maze into a
/// [Sponge Schematic (v3)](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Schematic-Specification/blob/master/versions/schematic-3.md),
/// and returns it as a gzipped serialised NBT byte array. Note that schematics cannot be used
/// directly with the vanilla game, and must be imported with mods or 3rd-party tools (such as
/// [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit/)).
///
/// The blocks used cannot be changed, however most programs that let you import schematics
/// also let you replace blocks of one type with another. The vanilla game also supports this
/// on small areas with [`/fill <from> <to> replace <block>`](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/fill).
