//! A variety of built-in implementations of the interfaces defined in [`crate::interface`].
//!
//! If you are not doing anything special, and just generating/solving regular mazes,
//! you can use the implementations in this crate instead of rolling your own.
//!
//! Despite what the name may otherwise imply, public items found in this module are
//! considered API and are safe to use.
