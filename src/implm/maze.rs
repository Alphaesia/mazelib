//! implementors are just [`CellManager`][crate::interface::cell::CellManager]s.

//! replacing "CellManager" with "Maze". This is to match the `CellManager`/
//! `Maze` split discussed in [`Maze`][crate::interface::maze::Maze] for
//! `CellManager` implementations.

/// Use these names when modelling cell managers as maze carriers. Use
/// their other names when modelling them as maze components.
