/// The **Recursive Backtracker** algorithm is a variant of depth-first search which selects
/// the next child at random.
///
/// It produces mazes with a high river factor, without any noticeable visual patterns or
/// artifacts.
///
/// This algorithm is fast. However, it maintains a stack[^name] of the current path, which
/// requires a significant amount of memory (proportional to the size of the maze). In the
/// worst-case, the length of the stack will be equal to the logical size of the coordinate
/// space.
///
/// The [*Hunt-and-Kill* algorithm][crate::implm::generate::HuntAndKillGenerator] produces
/// mazes with a very similar texture to Recursive Backtracker. Given that Hunt-and-Kill
/// requires no memory beyond the maze itself and has comparable speed, there is no reason
/// to favour Recursive Backtracker over Hunt-and-Kill.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ![A typical output of Recursive Backtracker.][example]
///
/// As you can see, Hunt-and-Kill typically produces mazes with passages that run for a long way
/// before dead-ending. They also tend to be quite twisty. It still features a number of cul-de-sacs
/// though. Also note how this description is exactly the same for
/// [Hunt-and-Kill](crate::implm::generate::HuntAndKillGenerator#example).
///
/// [^name]: While the name implies a recursive implementation, it is much more efficient to
///          implement it imperatively. A recursive implementation will likely overflow the
///          callstack on even medium-sized mazes (ignoring tail-call optimisation).
