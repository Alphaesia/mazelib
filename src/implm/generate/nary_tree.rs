/// The ***n*-ary Tree** algorithm is a generalisation of the *Binary Tree* algorithm
/// to higher dimensions.
///
/// Starting from the origin, then iterating sequentially, it connects every cell to
/// a random unvisited neighbour. In [box coordinate spaces][BoxCoordinateSpace]
/// this will produce a tree-like structure, hence the name. In fact, *n* is the
/// dimension of the coordinate space. Due to the fact that randomly selecting
/// neighbours is not guaranteed to produce a tree-like structure on all coordinate
/// spaces, *n*-ary Tree is only implemented on `BoxCoordinateSpace`.
///
/// *n*-ary Tree produces mazes with an exceptionally strong diagonal bias. It also
/// always produces straight passages along axes that intersect the corner opposite
/// the origin (see the example below).
///
/// This trade-off however allows the algorithm to be exceptionally fast --- the
/// fastest among all the algorithms --- and use no extra memory.
///
/// Using this algorithm will require careful consideration of the diagonal bias,
/// as it is extremely easy to traverse the maze along the grain.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ![A typical output of n-ary Tree.][example]
///
/// Notice the long passageways on the bottom and right edges, and how all other passages
/// head towards that bottom-right corner. Passages will never curl in on themselves. Once
/// a passage goes right, it will never go left again (ignoring intersections). Likewise
/// for down/up.
