//! A variety of different maze generators built-in.
//!
//! The documentation for each algorithm contains a brief overview of
//! the algorithm, the texture it produces, and some notable performance
//! characteristics to be aware of.
//!
//! [ThinkLabyrinth has a page that compares all the algorithms featured here and provides more detail and examples.](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm#perfect)
//!
//! The [Hunt-and-Kill algorithm][HuntAndKillGenerator] is **recommended
//! as the default algorithm**. It produces high-quality mazes while
//! maintaining high performance.
//!
//! # Comparison by Example
//!
//! Here is a comparison of the typical output of each generator. You can
//! see commentary on each example on their individual pages.
