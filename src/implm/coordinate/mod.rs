//! Coordinators for the other built-in components.
//!
//! There isn't a coordinator for every built-in (`CellValue`-`CoordinateSpace`) pair but the
//! common cases are covered (or at least, will be in future). If you desire a coordinator for a
//! pair not implemented here you should be able to use the existing implementations as a
//! reference.
//! 
//! # Comparison by Example
//! 
//! Here is a comparison of a typical maze of each coordinator. You can see commentary on each
//! example on their individual pages.
