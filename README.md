## Why use this library?

### You want to generate big mazes, quickly.

This library is designed to be as reasonably performant as possible.

### You want to produce mazes with a custom output.

Most maze generators will only produce mazes with predefined outputs (like printing to console or creating an image). With this library, you can produce mazes in any format you like. Want to produce JavaScript that will draw the maze to a canvas? All you need to do is implement a custom MazeRenderer. You don't have to write any maze generation code yourself.

### You want to write your own maze generator.

## Why not to use this library?

### You want something opinionated.

This is library is designed for complete flexibility. There is plenty of code on the internet that will generate mazes in only one or a few styles.
